#Write a program to calculate the credit card balance after one year if a person only pays the minimum monthly payment required by the credit card company each month.

#tips:
# For each month, calculate satements on the monthly payment and remaining balnce and print
#do not print out mor ethan two decimal places (use the round() function!)
#Finally, print out the total amount paid that year 

#This is going to be a loop over 12 cycles that will need to print over each cycle

#use these three variables

#balance-total outstanding balance, annualInterestRate-annual interest rate as decimal, monthlyPaymentRate- minimum monthly payment rate as decimal

#Break this down into steps...

#For each month:
#Compute the monthly payment, based on the previous monthâ€™s balance.
#Update the outstanding balance by removing the payment, then charging interest on the result.
#Output the month, the minimum monthly payment and the remaining balance.
#Keep track of the total amount of paid over all the past months so far.
#Print out the result statement with the total amount paid and the remaining balance.
